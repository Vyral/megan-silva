<center>I&rsquo;m sharing three tasks to complete to prepare your home for sale.</center>

&nbsp;

Welcome to my new blog, thank you for visiting\! My first topic is about the three things you need to do to prepare your home for sale. These three simple tasks can make all the difference when selling:

**1\. Declutter.** Get rid of anything you can, and organize what you want to keep. This will also make your move easier. Remove pieces of furniture or anything else that makes a room feel heavy. Clear away papers and knick-knacks, and start packing early if possible.&nbsp;

**2\. Depersonalize.** Make your house look like a hotel, it should feel warm and bright but remain neutral. You want buyers to picture themselves living in the home, making them not want to leave\!

**3\. Make repairs.** Perfect your house’s look by repairing all visible damage. What you’ll need to do varies from home to home. You may need to repair cracks in the walls, paint (a shade of white is all you should be using), fix broken hinges, and so on.

Feel free to call me to come out and walk through the home with you. I can point out what may need to be done before you list. Please reach out via phone or email if you have questions or need real estate help of any kind. I look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;
