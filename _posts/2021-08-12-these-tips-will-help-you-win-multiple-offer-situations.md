*Here are three C’s that will help you win in a multiple-offer situation.*

We’re still in a seller’s market, and it’s leaving a lot of buyers frustrated. With multiple-offer situations being so common, how do you get a competitive home? Today I’ll share the three C’s that can help you win a multiple-offer situation.

Before we go any further, I should mention another ‘C’ that can help you out: Calling me\! I know all the tips I’m about to share and more, so **if you hire me as your agent, I can use every trick in the book to help you win. **

The first C I want to share with you is **confidence.** As a buyer, you have to believe your offer will win. I’ve seen a few buyers who wanted to buy a home, but they sat out of the market for years because they were intimidated. In that time, they missed out on potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in appreciation. Therefore, it’s important to remember that searching for a home should be fun. You’re working with a professional, and with time and patience, you will find the home of your dreams.

The second C is **communication.** There are a lot of parties in a real estate transaction. Besides yourself, you have to worry about the agent, the seller, the listing agent, your lender, and more. A big part of my job is to make sure all these parties are on the same page. Meanwhile, you can focus on your job, your family, or whatever else matters to you.

The third C is my favorite: **Creativity.** In this market, you have to get creative with your offers. No two sellers are the same, and I’ve never written two contracts with identical terms. Thinking outside the box is always important, but it is especially so when the market is competitive. Whether you waive contingencies or offer in cash, there are plenty of ways to make your offer more attractive.

If you are a confident buyer that is ready to jump into this market, or if you’ve been working with an agent that isn’t working out, give me a call at (310) 614-6513 or email me at [megan@megansilva.com](mailto:megan@megansilva.com). I look forward to hearing from you\!
