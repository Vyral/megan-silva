Here are three things you should be doing when getting your home ready for sale:

**1\. Depersonalize.** It’s not you, it’s them. Buyers lack imagination, so we need to make your house look as neutral as possible. You want it to be almost like a hotel.&nbsp;

**2\. Declutter.** Get rid of almost everything. Pack up most of your furniture, sometimes all of it if we’re investing in staging. More space means more opportunities for buyers to picture themselves living in a home.

**3\. Make visible repairs.** I work with a team that comes in, identifies key repairs, and makes them. We won’t remodel anything, but we’ll fix cracks, holes, or other imperfections that would cause a buyer to take pause.

If you don’t want to do any of this and you’d rather sell it as is, some developers are paying a lot of money simply for land. If you fall into that boat, I can help you there as well.

If you’re thinking of selling, buying, or have any other real estate-related questions, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
