This time of year is when everyone starts gearing up for the holidays, and many people are under the impression that homes don’t sell in the fall and winter. However, I tell my clients that there is a real opportunity to stand out as a seller in this unique, seasonal market.&nbsp;

**With fewer homes on the market, there is less competition for you as a seller.** There are always buyers out there, whether that be due to birth, marriages, or job transfers.&nbsp;

These are serious buyers that are looking to make a purchase now. There are a lot of buyers in the spring and summer that aren’t necessarily committed to buying, but you won't find them out in the market during this time of year.

**There’s a sense of urgency that isn’t there the rest of the year.**

Another reason why I love the fall market is that the negotiations are easier. I don’t know if it’s the holiday spirit, but people tend to be in a better mood, and negotiations are more flexible. If you’ve been considering selling but want to wait until spring, you might not need to. Reach out to me today; let’s talk about your situation and see if we can take advantage of this fall market. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
